      prompt: |
        Create a comprehensive daily news briefing from the following research results.
        
        Topic: {{topic}}
        Current Date: {{current_date}}
        Timeframe: {{start_date_natural}} to {{end_date_natural}}
        
        Research Evidence ({{evidence_count}} items total, showing top 50):
        {{evidence_full_text}}
        
        Please create a well-structured briefing with the following sections:
        
        1. EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
        Write a 2-3 sentence overview of the most important developments including the most important URLs.
        
        2. KEY DEVELOPMENTS
        List 3-5 major news items, each formatted as:
        • Headline: specific development (2-3 sentences with key facts, numbers, dates, people involved)
          Source: (Date) [URL]
        
        3. DETAILED ANALYSIS BY THEME
        Create 2-4 thematic sections based on what's most relevant to "{{topic}}".
        Choose themes that reflect the actual news (e.g., "New Drug Approvals", "Supply Chain Disruptions", "Price Changes", "Clinical Trial Results", "Company Acquisitions", "Regulatory Decisions", etc.)
        
        For each theme:
        - Theme title
        - Brief overview (1 sentence)
        - Bullet points with specific, newsworthy information:
          • Concrete fact or development (Date) [Source URL]
          • Another specific update (Date) [Source URL]
        
        DO NOT include:
        - Generic descriptions of websites or resources
        - Explanations of what organizations do
        - Background context that isn't news
        ONLY include:
        - Actual events, announcements, changes
        - Specific data, numbers, names
        - Recent developments and their direct impacts
        
        4. NOTABLE MENTIONS
        Brief bullet points of other relevant but less critical updates
        Each with format: "• Specific news item (Date) [Source URL]"
        
        5. ALL SOURCES
        Complete list of all sources used, formatted as:
        - Publication/Website (Date): URL
        Include the date for each source if available
        
        Write in clear, professional language suitable for a business briefing.
        Focus on facts and concrete information from the sources.
        Include source URLs directly after each piece of information.
        
        IMPORTANT: 
        - Only output the 5 sections listed above - nothing else
        - Do NOT add any conversational text like "If you'd like..." or "I can help with..."
        - Do NOT offer additional services or ask questions
        - End the briefing after section 5 (ALL SOURCES)
        - Focus on NEWS - what happened, was announced, changed, or was discovered
        - Exclude generic resource descriptions or website overviews
        - Every point must be a concrete, newsworthy item
        - Themes must be specific to the search topic, not generic categories
        - AVOID DUPLICATION: Each news item should appear only ONCE in the briefing (choose the most relevant section)
        - If evidence lacks dates, mark as "(Date not available)" not "(n.d.)"

  instructions: |
    You are writing a daily news briefing about {{topic}}.
    
    First, review the evidence collected to see if you have recent, comprehensive coverage.
    
    If you find that:
    - All evidence is older than 6 hours and this is breaking news: 
      Use exa_search("{{topic}} latest breaking today", num_results=5, search_recency_filter="day")
    
    - There are conflicting reports about key facts or numbers:
      Use exa_answer("{{topic}} verified facts timeline of events today")
    
    - You have general information but lack today's specific updates:
      Use sonar_call("{{topic}} what happened today latest updates", search_recency_filter="day")
    
    Only make ONE tool call if absolutely necessary for report completeness.
    
    Then write these sections:
    - Breaking News (most recent developments)
    - Key Developments (3-5 major items with details)
    - Analysis by Theme (2-3 thematic sections based on the news)
    - Market Impact (if relevant)
    - Notable Mentions (other relevant updates)
    - Sources (complete numbered list with dates and full URLs)
    
    IMPORTANT:
    - Use [1], [2], etc. to reference sources in the text
    - List all sources at the end with numbers, dates, and complete URLs
    - Do NOT add any text like "If you want I can produce..." or offer additional services
    - End the report immediately after the Sources section
