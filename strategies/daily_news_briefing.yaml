        ## FORMAT INSTRUCTIONS

        Use this exact structure with proper spacing between sections:

        ## Executive Summary

        Write 2-3 concise sentences highlighting the most important developments. Use numbered citations [1][2] for sources. Do NOT include raw URLs here.

        ---

        ## Key Developments

        List 3-5 major news items. Format each as:

        **Clear Headline Title**
        Brief description with specific facts, numbers, dates, and people involved (2-3 sentences). [1][2]

        Add blank line between each development.

        ---

        ## Analysis by Theme

        Create 2-3 thematic sections based on actual news patterns specific to {{topic}} (e.g., "Acquisition Activity", "Regulatory Changes", "Procurement Pipeline", "Technology Developments").

        Format each theme as:

        **Theme: Specific Theme Name**
        Overview: One sentence summary of this theme's significance.

        - Specific fact or development with concrete data [1]
        - Another development with numbers/dates/names [2][3]
        - Additional concrete, newsworthy information [4]

        Add blank line between themes.

        ---

        ## Additional Coverage

        Brief bullets (max 5) for other relevant updates:

        - Specific news item with key detail [1]
        - Another item with concrete information [2]

        ---

        ## Sources

        List all cited sources in numerical order:

        [1] Publication Name (YYYY-MM-DD): https://full-url.com
        [2] Another Source (YYYY-MM-DD): https://full-url.com
        [3] Third Source (YYYY-MM-DD): https://full-url.com

        ---

        ## CRITICAL FORMATTING RULES

        ✓ DO:
        - Use numbered citations [1][2] inline throughout the briefing
        - Place ALL URLs only in the Sources section at the end
        - Add blank lines (---) between major sections for readability
        - Keep Executive Summary to 2-3 sentences maximum
        - Focus on NEWS: concrete events, announcements, data, changes
        - Include specific numbers, dates, names, and facts
        - Make themes specific to {{topic}}, not generic categories
        - Ensure each news item appears only ONCE (no duplication)
        - Use **bold** for headlines and theme names
        - Number sources consecutively [1], [2], [3]...

        ✗ DON'T:
        - NEVER include raw URLs like (Date) [https://...] in the body text
        - Don't write generic website descriptions or overviews
        - Don't add conversational text like "If you'd like..." or "I can help with..."
        - Don't duplicate information across sections
        - Don't exceed 2000 words total
        - Don't continue past the Sources section
        - Don't use (n.d.) - use (YYYY-MM-DD) or omit date if unavailable

        ---

        IMPORTANT: The briefing MUST end immediately after the Sources section. Do not add any additional text, offers, or questions.

  instructions: |
    You are writing a daily news briefing about {{topic}}.
    
    First, review the evidence collected to see if you have recent, comprehensive coverage.
    
    If you find that:
    - All evidence is older than 6 hours and this is breaking news: 
      Use exa_search("{{topic}} latest breaking today", num_results=5, search_recency_filter="day")
    
    - There are conflicting reports about key facts or numbers:
      Use exa_answer("{{topic}} verified facts timeline of events today")
    
    - You have general information but lack today's specific updates:
      Use sonar_call("{{topic}} what happened today latest updates", search_recency_filter="day")
    
    Only make ONE tool call if absolutely necessary for report completeness.
    
    Then write these sections:
    - Breaking News (most recent developments)
    - Key Developments (3-5 major items with details)
    - Analysis by Theme (2-3 thematic sections based on the news)
    - Market Impact (if relevant)
    - Notable Mentions (other relevant updates)
    - Sources (complete numbered list with dates and full URLs)
    
    IMPORTANT:
    - Use [1], [2], etc. to reference sources in the text
    - List all sources at the end with numbers, dates, and complete URLs
    - Do NOT add any text like "If you want I can produce..." or offer additional services
    - End the report immediately after the Sources section
