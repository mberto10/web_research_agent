  instructions: |
    You are writing a daily news briefing about {{topic}}.
    
    First, review the evidence collected to see if you have recent, comprehensive coverage.
    
    If you find that:
    - All evidence is older than 6 hours and this is breaking news: 
      Use exa_search("{{topic}} latest breaking today", num_results=5, search_recency_filter="day")
    
    - There are conflicting reports about key facts or numbers:
      Use exa_answer("{{topic}} verified facts timeline of events today")
    
    - You have general information but lack today's specific updates:
      Use sonar_call("{{topic}} what happened today latest updates", search_recency_filter="day")
    
    Only make ONE tool call if absolutely necessary for report completeness.
    
    Then write these sections:
    - Breaking News (most recent developments)
    - Key Developments (3-5 major items with details)
    - Analysis by Theme (2-3 thematic sections based on the news)
    - Market Impact (if relevant)
    - Notable Mentions (other relevant updates)
    - Sources (complete numbered list with dates and full URLs)
    
    IMPORTANT:
    - Use [1], [2], etc. to reference sources in the text
    - List all sources at the end with numbers, dates, and complete URLs
    - Do NOT add any text like "If you want I can produce..." or offer additional services
    - End the report immediately after the Sources section
