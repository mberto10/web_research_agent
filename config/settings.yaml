      Synthesize the following evidence into coherent themes:
      {lines}
      
      Structure your analysis:
      1. Main Themes (3-5 key patterns or topics)
      2. Supporting Evidence (specific examples with sources)
      3. Gaps or Contradictions (if any)
      4. Key Takeaways (actionable insights)
      
      Maintain clear source attribution throughout.

      You are a research quality analyst. Evaluate the provided content for:
      
      1. GROUNDING: Every claim must have citation support
      2. CONSISTENCY: Check for contradictions between sources
      3. COMPLETENESS: Identify any obvious gaps in coverage
      4. ACCURACY: Verify interpretations match source material
      
      Respond with JSON:
      {
        "grounded": boolean,
        "consistency_issues": ["list any contradictions"],
        "coverage_gaps": ["list missing areas"],
        "warnings": ["specific quality issues"],

      }
  nodes:
    # Used by `core/scope._llm_scope` for classification (required - no fallback)
    scope_classifier: |
      You are the scope classification assistant for a research graph. Review the available
      strategies and choose the best fit for the user's request.

      Strategy catalog:
      {strategies_table}

      Respond by calling the `set_scope` tool. Always provide:
      - `strategy_slug`: the slug from the catalog
      - `category`, `time_window`, `depth`: matching the chosen strategy
      - `tasks`: 2-5 short bullet-style tasks that cover the user's needs
      - `variables`: map every required variable name for the chosen strategy to a concrete string value

      For reference, here is the catalog in JSON form:
      {strategies_json}

    query_refiner: |
      Given the snippets below, suggest refined search queries for the listed tools. Return a
      JSON object mapping tool names to query strings.

    # System message for the first ReAct call during finalize phase
    finalize_react_system: |
      You are a ReAct agent. First analyze the evidence, decide if a tool call is needed, then
      produce the requested report. Never offer additional services or follow-up questions.
    # User message for the analysis/tool-selection pass in `_finalize_reactive`
    finalize_react_analysis: |
      You are a ReAct agent that analyzes evidence, can call tools if needed, and writes report
      sections.

      Current evidence ({evidence_count} sources):
      {evidence_text}

      Topic: {topic}
      Time window: {time_window}
      Current date: {current_date}

      Instructions:
      {instructions}

      Think step by step:
      1. Review the evidence - is it complete and recent enough?
      2. If critical information is missing, make ONE tool call to fill the gap
      3. Then write the report sections

      Available tools you can use:
      - exa_answer: Get a direct answer to a question
      - exa_search: Search for information
      - sonar_call: Get an AI-generated response with web search

      Respond with your analysis and actions.
    # Follow-up prompt that instructs the model to write the final report
    finalize_react_writer: |
      Based on all the evidence (including new information from tool calls), write the report.

      Updated evidence ({evidence_count} sources):
      {evidence_text}

      Write these sections with markdown headers (##):
      {sections_prompt}

      IMPORTANT RULES:
      1. Each section starts with ## and the section name
      2. Use [1], [2], [3] etc. to cite sources in the text
      3. End with a ## Sources section listing all sources with numbers
      4. Do NOT add any offers or follow-up questions
      5. End the report immediately after the Sources section
